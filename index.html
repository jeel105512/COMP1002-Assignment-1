<!-- Creating a portfolio website:
1. Home page - This should contain content that will introduce you and provide a call to action to contact you. You want to stand out from the crowd, so consider what elements make the most sense on this page without duplicating your content from your other pages. This page should have key points, but not go into depth on any specific skill as your about page will be responsible for that
2. About page - This will contain information about you (relevant to looking for a job). This can be your interests, achievements, skills, etc. Use the internet and look for some inspirations from other portfolio sites to determine what elements you want to plan for
3. Contact page - This page should contain relevant information for contacting you. You can plan for this to be a form (as we will cover forms soon). You can provide other details on this page like your email, LinkedIn profile link, GitHub link (to your public projects), etc -->

                <h1>Hi, I am Jeel.</h1>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in Computer Programming course in Georgian college and have some great
                    expectations from the college after I finish my college.
                    I want to be a good software and frontend developer and have a goal to get a job as a software
                    engineer or as a developer in Google. I also have interests in business and
                    management. Personally I want to create a side source of income through my e-commerce business,
                    through real estate and stock market. I do know that my interests which I think
                    will help me create a good passive income contain literally every way of making money but I want to
                    try all of them and which one fits perfectly for me.

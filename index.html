Creating a portfolio website:
1. Home page - This should contain content that will introduce you and provide a call to action to contact you. You want to stand out from the crowd, so consider what elements make the most sense on this page without duplicating your content from your other pages. This page should have key points, but not go into depth on any specific skill as your about page will be responsible for that
2. About page - This will contain information about you (relevant to looking for a job). This can be your interests, achievements, skills, etc. Use the internet and look for some inspirations from other portfolio sites to determine what elements you want to plan for
3. Contact page - This page should contain relevant information for contacting you. You can plan for this to be a form (as we will cover forms soon). You can provide other details on this page like your email, LinkedIn profile link, GitHub link (to your public projects), etc
